BRANCH & MERGE
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

1. list your branches (a * will appear next to the currently active branch)
git branch

2. list your branches on remote machine 
git branch -r 

3. list all brances (local and remote)
git branch -a

4. create a new branch at the current commit
git branch [branch-name]

5. switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
git checkout [branch-name]

6. create and switch to another branch in one step: 
git checkout -b [branch name]

7. switch to the previous branch 
git checkout - 

8. push a new branch on remote repository (the first time only)
git push -u origin feature-a 

9. delete a branch 
git checkout main 
git branch -d [branch name]

10. merge the specified branch’s history into the main
git checkout main
git merge [branch]

11. show all commits in the current branch’s history
git log

12 show all commits in the current branch's history by one line 
git log --oneline
